      indicating child leave
#2625 A neighbor table entry that corresponds to coordinator has 
      DEVICE_TYPE_ROUTER role

Resolved issues:
#2648 AVR Studio project for Raven 3290P LCD controller was corrected.
#2636 WSNDemo protocol description document was converted to Atmel application 
      note format.

BitCloud 1.3.0:

New features:
Support of RZRAVEN Kit was added.
All code was transferred to avr-gcc 4.3.2 compiler.

New features:
#2548 Timer\Counter1 is free now.
#2546 Support of VCP on ARM platform was added.
#2498 RxOnWhenIdle, Relationship, PermitJoining, PotentialParent, Depth 
      are additionally provided by ZDO_GetNeibTable(Neib_t * table ).
#2519 Possibility to obtain real value of RF TX power was added.

      CS_MANUFACTURER_CODE_ID - 16-bit manufacturer code allocated by 
        the ZigBee Alliance
      CS_COMPLEX_DESCRIPTOR_AVAILABLE_ID - Specifies whether a complex 
        descriptor is available on this device
      CS_USER_DESCRIPTOR_AVAILABLE_ID - Specifies whether a user descriptor 
        is available on this device.
#2547 Support of Alerton board was added.

      is stored to EEPROM.

Resolved issues:
#2555 Incorrect behaviour when broadcasting frames with radius larger than 0
      was fixed.

BitCloud 1.2.0:

New features:
Auto network feature was removed from stack and reimplemented on the 
application level.
ZDP user descriptor support added.
ZDO MGMT LQI request support added.
Stack now provides a way for an application on coordinator to configure
short PAN ID instead of generating it randomly.
Stack enables correct work of the network consisting of 50 nodes.
Autonetwork feature implemented

Resolved issues:
Sometimes a router could freeze when working with indirect transactions.
Unpredictable MAC confirmations could emerge during the MAC reset procedure.
Broadcast data transmission reliability was about ~50%.
A router joining to a secured network was incorrectly assigned a child status 
(instead of neighbor).
Router did not send a new short address in rejoin response to a joining 
device whose short address was already contained in its neighbour table.
A newly joining device with short address similar to one of those already 
contained in the neighbor table received secured rejoin response and thus was 
unable to join.
Sometimes beacon was not sent after a beacon request.
End device did not update its parent address.
Application did not receive ZDO_SleepConf if an end device has lost the 
network.
ZDP requests performed by a device locally (i.e. on itself) always failed on 
timeout.
ZDO_GetNeibTable() could return non-empty table for a device with no neighbors.
Performing an ED scan on a remote device always failed on timeout.

BitCloud 1.1.1:

New features:
When a coordinator with null CS_UID takes its extended PANID for CS_UID,
it is not kept in persistent memory.
Getting address of the first hop to certain destination.
End device may go asleep when not joined to a network.
ZDO_GetNeibAmount() and ZDO_GetNeibTable() functions added.

Resolved issues:
Fixed bug that hindered separate compilation for different node roles.
Routers and end devices with AUTONETWORK option off could
perform automatic rejoin.
If an end device was reset while waiting for APS ack, it 
stopped further attempts to join the network.
Coordinator took its COORDINATOR_EXT_PANID instead of CS_UID
for MAC address on startup.
Coordinator took null MAC address instead of CS_UID
when starting network with null extended PANID.
End device could not be put asleep by ZDO_SleepReq() function
when not joined to a network.
Sometimes APS ack was missing.
APS_DataConf did not appear sometimes if a device has left the network.
Incorrect battery status calculation.
Asynchronous SPI mode was not available without rebuilding stack.
Somatimes router did not process indirect transactions correctly. 
A node with invalid extended PANID sometimes appeared in beacon frame.
PAN ID conflict resolution could lead to loss of nodes.
End device incorrectly processed leave command received during rejoin 
procedure.
Routers sometimes did not update capacity information for end devices.
After sending leave request to an unexistent end device, router stopped 
answering all beacon requests.
Coordinator occasionally sent Update device command to itself.
Confirmation callback for ZDO_SetTxPowerReq() was never returned.
